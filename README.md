# Restaurant tips analysis
*This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.*

#### Dataset
The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987. You can get access to the dataset by following  this link:  [Restaurant_tip_data.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv)

**Description** 
It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, in the following columns:
1. id: A unique identifier for each record in the dataset.
2. total_bill: The total amount of the bill in US dollars (USD).
3. tip: The amount of tip given in US dollars (USD).
4. sex: The gender of the person paying the bill, categorized as Male or Female.
5. smoker: Indicates whether the individual is a smoker (Yes or No).
6. day: The day of the week the bill was paid (e.g., Sun for Sunday).
7. time: The meal time, categorized as Lunch or Dinner.
8. size: The size of the dining party (number of people).

#### The main goals
- Investigate how factors such as gender, smoking status, dining day, and meal time influence the tip amount.
- Highlight any noticeable trends in tipping habits, such as whether male customers or non-smokers tip more on average.
- Practice Data Analysis skills including working with datasets, creating meaningful visualizations, and interpreting statistical insights.
- Provide practical insights that could help restaurants understand tipping behaviors and inform potential strategies to improve service or tip amounts.

 #### Results
- The tipping percentage varies significantly across demographic groups, time of day, and dining party sizes.
- Gender and smoking preferences as tip values influencers: The slightly higher tips among smokers than non-smokers and male customers than females may warrant further investigation to explore underlying causes, such as group sizes, dining experience, or spending habits.
- Meal time and day of the week: Dinner time and weekends seem to be the better times for earning tips. Therefore, restaurants may prepare for higher tipping by having more staff or offering better service during weekends and dinner time to make the most of it.
